        <span>Coffee is a beloved brewed beverage renowned for its distinctive aroma and rich flavor, </span>
        <span>derived from the seeds nestled within the "berries" of coffee plants. </span>
        <span>These plants thrive in over 70 countries, primarily clustered around the equatorial regions of Latin America, Southeast Asia, India, and Africa. </span>
        <span>Among the diverse coffee cultivars, two reign supreme: the highly esteemed Arabica and the robust Robusta. While Arabica boasts a refined taste, </span>
        <span>Robusta offers a more robust and resilient profile, making it less susceptible to coffee leaf rust, known scientifically as Hemileia vastatrix. </span>
        <span>However, its flavor tends to carry a sharper bitterness. </span>
        <span>Once the coffee berries ripen to perfection, skilled hands meticulously pick, process, and dry the beans, ensuring optimal quality. </span>
        <span>Remarkably, green (unroasted) coffee beans emerge as one of the most sought-after agricultural commodities globally, contributing significantly to international trade. </span>
        <span>This intricate journey, from cultivation to consumption, underscores coffee's unparalleled allure and enduring global appeal. </span>
